\maketitle

In LLVM and other modern compilers, static single assignment (SSA) form
enables optimizations in
imperative code. Dominance relations determine where the SSA variables may be
referenced. Computing these relations is a basic operation in compilers that
use SSA form.
Dominator trees have historically been a good approximation of the dominance
relation and can be computed efficiently. However, there are programs for which the
dominator tree fails to capture precise dominance relations, thereby inhibiting
optimizations. In this work, we demonstrate a more general dominance
relation using a small set of dominator trees instead of a single tree. The
trees in this dominator \emph{grove} are keyed by a set of branch instructions 
that share a common condition variable. We show, with examples, how this 
enables more precise dominance relations and, consequently, more 
optimizations. We present a work-in-progress implementation of a
dominator grove in LLVM, including some challenges in modifying
the existing analyses and transformations to be sound in the presence of
non-tree dominance relations. Using this implementation, we collect empirical
data on the frequency of non-tree dominance relations in real code. We present
some basic formal properties of the approach, and end with a discussion of
future work, including concurrent extensions to SSA theory.  

\section*{Motivation}
Recall the definition of dominance in the context of programs: a node $a$
dominates a node $b$ if every \emph{valid} path from the entry block to $b$ goes
through $a$. Note that we specify valid paths explicitly. Historically,
dominance has focused on any path through the control flow graph (CFG).
Because we care about dominance in \emph{programs}, we need to reason about
valid paths beyond just the CFG. 

To understand non-tree dominance relations, consider the following example: 
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
void f(bool c, int x){
  int y = 0;         \\ entry
  if(c) y = pre(x);  \\ pre
  body(x);           \\ body	
  if(c) post(y);     \\ post
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
Note that there are two valid paths through the function: one which calls
\texttt{pre} and \texttt{post} and one which doesn't. Therefore, by the
definition of dominance, the call to \texttt{post} is dominated by the call to
\texttt{pre}. Representing the dominance relations graphically gives: 
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->, line width=0.3mm]
\node(entry) at (2,3) {\texttt{entry}};
\node(a) at (1,2) {\texttt{pre}};
\node(b) at (3,2) {\texttt{body}};
\node(c) at (2,1) {\texttt{post}};
\path
(entry) edge (a)
(entry) edge (b)
(a) edge (c)
(b) edge (c);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center} 
Clearly, this is not a tree. Using a dominator \emph{tree}, one is unable
to determine that \texttt{pre} dominates \texttt{post}. The value of
\texttt{y}, therefore, cannot be referenced in \texttt{post}, which could 
result in missed optimizations.

\section*{Implementation}
The crucial property that lets us refine the notion of valid paths and
thereby refine the dominance relation, is that whenever there are multiple
conditional branches that share a condition variable $c$, we can construct
two distinct dominator trees for cases where $c=false$ and $c=true$. If a dominance
relation holds for both dominator trees, then it holds in the general case. We
call this structure a dominator \emph{grove}, as it contains a small set of
trees. Because of this dependence on condition variables, one can view this
approach as a class of \emph{context-sensitive} dominance relations. This is in
contrast to the dominator tree, which is computed from the CFG, and captures no
additional context.

We present an initial implementation of the dominator grove approach in LLVM.
By modifying the existing implementation of incremental dominator tree updates,
we show how one can extend the implementation of dominator trees to implement
dominator groves in a way that requires only a relatively small change to the
codebase.\cite{georgiadis2012experimental}

While the implementation successfully computes more precise dominance
relations, there is a problem: the extra precision appears to break existing
analysis and transformation passes. While we are still not sure what causes 
these issues, we believe it to be due to assumptions made about the nature of
dominance. These assumptions are violated by the more precise dominance
relations enabled by the dominator grove. We hope to discuss some of the challenges in
removing these assumptions from LLVM, and to get feedback from the community on
the cost of addressing these assumptions.

\section*{Empirical Measures}
In the above example we have shown the existence of programs with non-tree
dominance relations. A natural question is how often these kinds of
programs occur in practice. To measure this, we ran the implementation
described above on the \texttt{llvm-test-suite}. We discovered that out of the
$\approx55$ million calls to \texttt{dominates}, $\approx1.9$ million calls
--- $\approx 3.5\%$ -- were made
more precise by the dominator grove. This shows that there are
a non-trivial number of non-tree dominance relations in real world code. We
look forward to discussing a further breakdown of the data with the community.

\section*{Verification}
In the interest of ensuring correctness of the approach, we have proved a number
of simple but important properties. First, and most obviously, every valid path 
through the program is a valid path through the CFG. Next, following direcly
from the above, every dominator grove relation is at least as precise 
as a dominator tree. In other words, if a relation holds for the dominator tree, 
then it holds for the dominator grove. This ensures that we are never
decreasing the precision of the dominance relations.

\section*{Concurrency}
In addition to improving optimizations for sequential programs, we argue that 
removing the tree constraints from dominance relations is necessary to build a
concurrent SSA theory. To be able to run two pieces of code concurrently, then
wait for them to finish, we need to be able to represent that neither dominates
the other, but both dominate the join point. We look forward to discussing
with the community how SSA and LLVM can be extended with concurrent
semantics.

\section*{Future Work}
While adding the ability to compute more precise dominance relations requires
a fairly small change, it's not clear how much existing code that assumes a 
dominator tree structure in the analysis and transformation passes will need to be
changed. We hope to get feedback from the community on how best to move forward
to maximize the likelihood of getting this approach integrated into LLVM.
